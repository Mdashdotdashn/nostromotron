This repository contains the code and schematics to demonstrate how to control a monotron using a Teensy chip and therefore trigger it via MIDI.

[monotron_control]

contains a simple version of the code where you can control the pitch of the analog oscillator using MIDI

[nostromotron]

contains a fully fledge expanded version of the monotron/teensy coupling that provides:

+ Midi triggering
+ An additional digital oscillator fed to the monotron via the headphone in
+ Filter envelope
+ Fully controllable via MIDI CC
